		<h1>Sequences</h1>

		<p>African Horse Sickness sequences were downloaded from GenBank on 25th Oct 2013.<br>
		Initial processing to split the sequences into separate files according to segment was performed using a custom R script 
		<a href="rscripts/epic_process_background_seqs_african_horse_sickness.R">epic_process_background_seqs_african_horse_sickness.R</a>, followed by manual editting of the sequence files.</p>

		<p>Nucleotide sequences (fasta format) were manually inspected and translated to amino acids for alignment using MUSCLE in MEGA 5.</p>
		<p>Neighbour joining trees (newick format) were created in MEGA with the TN93 model, pairwise deletetion, and heterogenous rates between sites and lineages.</p>

		<p>Segment and protein information from

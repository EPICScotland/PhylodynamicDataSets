PhylodynamicDataSets
====================

PhylodynamicDataSets contains reference sequence data and trees for pathogens of interest to EPIC.
It also contains some R utility script files used to generate the data where applicable.

The data and html pages are in the gh-pages branch, so the PhylodynamicDataSets webpages are live at:
